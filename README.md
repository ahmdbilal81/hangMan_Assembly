<h2>HangMan Game</h2>

<p>Welcome to the HangMan Game Clone project! This is a classical game, and in this simple project, I have created a clone of the iconic Hangman Game.</p>

<p>This project was developed by me for my friend during the final assessment for the Computer Organization and Assembly Language course at FAST-NU, Lahore, during our third semester of the Data Science degree.</p>

<h2>How to Use</h2>

<p>To enjoy the Hangman Game Clone, follow these simple steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Download nasm and doxbox</li>
<li>Place the asm file in the same folder</li>
<li>Run Dosbox and write</li>
<pre><code>mount c: (path to that folder)</code></pre>
<pre><code>c:</code></pre>

<li>Write</li>
<pre><code>nasm filename.asm -o filename.com</code></pre>
